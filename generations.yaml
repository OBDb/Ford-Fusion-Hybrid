    description: "The original Ford Fusion Hybrid was based on the first-generation Fusion, introduced as part of the mid-cycle refresh. Utilizing a powertrain similar to the Escape Hybrid, it combined a 2.5L Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and nickel-metal hydride battery for a combined output of 191 HP. The system could operate in electric-only mode up to 47 mph, contributing to its impressive EPA ratings of 41 mpg city and 36 mpg highwayâ€”class-leading figures at the time. The Fusion Hybrid featured a unique instrument cluster called SmartGauge with EcoGuide, using dual LCD displays flanking an analog speedometer to provide customizable information about the hybrid system's operation and coaching for maximizing efficiency. Visually distinguished by specific badges and unique wheels, it maintained the refreshed styling of the standard Fusion. This generation established the Fusion Hybrid as a strong competitor in the mid-size hybrid sedan segment, offering better driving dynamics than most competitors while delivering excellent fuel economy."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The second-generation Fusion Hybrid was completely redesigned alongside the conventional Fusion, featuring the sleek, European-inspired styling that characterized the platform. The hybrid powertrain evolved to combine a 2.0L Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a more compact, lighter lithium-ion battery pack replacing the previous nickel-metal hydride unit. Total system output was 188 HP, delivered through a continuously variable transmission to the front wheels. Fuel economy improved to an EPA-rated 44 mpg city, 41 mpg highway. The SmartGauge instrument cluster was enhanced with more detailed information and coaching features. For 2017, the Fusion Hybrid received a midcycle refresh with updated styling, enhanced technology features including SYNC 3, and the addition of the premium Platinum trim level offering luxury appointments like quilted leather seating. Throughout its production, the second-generation Fusion Hybrid maintained a reputation for combining excellent fuel economy with engaging handling and premium features, differentiating it from competitors that often sacrificed driving dynamics for efficiency. Production ended in 2020 alongside other Fusion models as Ford shifted its product strategy toward SUVs and fully electric vehicles."
